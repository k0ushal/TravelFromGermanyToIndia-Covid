## Travel Highlights:
1. Thermal screening done at Frankfurt airport
2. Hard copy of air ticket required at the airport

    2. These forms and the approvals can be shown on mobile phone
    3. No hardcopy required
5. No thermal screening or Covid formalities at Delhi airport
6. All Covid tests and evaluations were done at Mumbai airport
7. Aarogya Setu app activation is a must
8. Final Outcome
    1. No institutional quarantine
    2. Only home quarantine for 14 days


## DETAILED PROCESS:

### Things required:
1. Covid test with negative results.
    1. Should not be older than 96 hours at the time of arrival in Mumbai
2. Exemption request approval
3. Self reporting form (with green mark indicating Exemption request was approved)
    1. Having this expedites your arrival procedures in India.
4. Scanned copy of passport (PDF or JPG)
    1. To be attached to the online Self Reporting and Exemption Request forms.
    2. Must be < 1 MB in size
5. Scanned copy of Negative Covid test results
    1. Has to be consolidated into a single PDF for all co-passengers mentioned on the Exemption Request form
    2. Must also be < 1 MB in size
5. Printout of air ticket
    1. A copy of your air ticket will be stamped at various points. That’s why an e-copy of the ticket is not enough.
    2. At Frankfurt airport, there’s a booth where you can get your printout. This booth is located right at the Air India check in booths.
    3. But then this costs you an additional delay, so take your printouts with you.


### 1: Covid tests
As mentioned earlier, you want these test results to be as fresh as possible.
We got our tests done in Ravensburg, a neighboring town to my residence in Germany.
I went to the Labor (pathological laboratory) and explained to them the needs of my situation.
They were very cooperative in helping out with this.
It usually takes 24-48 hours for the test results to be ready.
The Labor set our tests to be executed on priority.
We got the swabs collected from our doctor and I hand-delivered these swabs in a sealed packet to the Labor. This was to ensure there’s no unnecessary delays from my doctor to deliver the swabs.
The reports were ready the next day, and I personally collected them as well from the Labor.<br>
**Price of the test:** ~100 euro per person (64 euros to Labor, 30 euros to the doctor)<br>
*(You can get these tests done at Frankfurt airport as well, but they cost I believe 59 euros per person to get the results within 12 hours, or ~130 euros to get the results within 6 hours.
Unfortunately getting the test at the airport won’t work 'coz by the time you have the test results in hand, it maybe too late to file for Exemption and the Self reporting form. Without the self reporting form with a green mark on it, your process at the airport gets unnecessarily longer.
Furthermore, there was a long queue for Covid tests at the airport.)*

### 2: Exemption request
When you have the Covid test receipts (with results pending), or preferably the reports with -ve result, you can apply for Exemption under category *‘Negative Covid Test results’.*
I had the reports with -ve results, so getting the exemption request approval was a piece of cake.
I received my approval from the Indian Govt. within an hour or so of submitting the request.
*Look at the bottom of this message for all form links.*
This is a self-explanatory form.
The only challenging thing was to create scanned copies of my passport and the Covid test results in a PDF file which is < 1 MB in size. 
If you don’t have experience with photoshop or other image editing tools, you’ll spend some time and/or money here.
Once you’ve filled up this form and submit it, you’ll get an ER number.
Within a few hours of that, you’ll get the Exemption Request results on your email.
If your request is approved, great. You can now proceed to submitting the Self Reporting form. If not, then check why they denied your request and try to fix that.
If you’re traveling with family, you can submit just one exemption request form for all of the passengers together. But then you’ll face issues making one PDF file containing the Covid test negative results for all the co-passengers. Note that this file should be < 1 MB in size.
You may file a separate Exemption request for each co-passenger in that case. And this would also mean a separate Self Reporting form.

### 3: Self Reporting form
This form has a field for Exemption Request number. You need an approved ER number.
Only then you’ll have the green mark on your Self Reporting form.
At the Mumbai airport I was asked to present the email received about the Self Reporting form with the green mark on it.
They insisted to see it on my phone instead of the hard copy of the document that I had printed out.


### The 72-hour window for form submission:
The guidelines page insists that the Exemption request form and self reporting form must be submitted 72 hours before departure.
But that is not true. At the Mumbai airport they didn’t care about when the form was submitted but only whether you have the green mark on your form.

I found out information about this process from the Air India customer care.
Make sure you call them in case there is any change in the process.

Good luck :)
